This is a brief READMe...very brief.

Whilst studying Python I was inspired by another student to create my own 'Choose your own Adventure' game. It looked pretty simple. I figured that I could probably do it better in Javascript as I prefer it over Python since it is more visual.
It has been a bit of a labour of love. Although it didn't take me very long to do as the majority of the work was the 5,500+ words or 30,000+ characters that are in the JS file. The coding is very easy to do and with patience it isn't that tricky to complete. 
I apologise for the lack of commits, but they really wouldn't have been that interesting. It would have been a constant barrage of "add another text/choice entry" very dull. 
Anyway I hope you enjoy it!
